  "infoIntro": "Buffon's Needle is a probability experiment first posed by the French mathematician Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1733. It is one of the oldest problems in geometric probability and provides a surprising way to estimate the value of $\\pi$ using nothing but randomness and geometry.",
  "infoSetupTitle": "Setup",
  "infoSetup": "A floor is ruled with parallel lines spaced a distance $d$ apart. A needle of length $l$ is dropped randomly onto the floor. We ask: what is the probability that the needle crosses one of the lines?",
  "infoConditionTitle": "Crossing condition",
  "infoCondition": "Let $y_c$ be the perpendicular distance from the needle's centre to the nearest line, and let $\\theta$ be the acute angle the needle makes with the lines. The needle crosses a line when its half-projection onto the perpendicular direction reaches the nearest line:",
  "infoConstraint": "This assumes the short-needle case $l \\leq d$, which guarantees the needle can cross at most one line at a time.",
  "infoProbTitle": "Probability",
  "infoProb": "Integrating over all possible positions and angles (both uniformly distributed), the theoretical crossing probability is:",
  "infoEstimateTitle": "Estimating $\\pi$",
  "infoEstimate": "After dropping $n$ needles and observing $c$ crossings, we can rearrange the probability formula to isolate $\\pi$:",
  "infoConverge": "The estimate improves as more needles are dropped — by the law of large numbers, the observed crossing ratio converges to the true probability, driving the $\\pi$ estimate toward $3.14159\\ldots$",
  "infoInteractTitle": "Interactive controls",
  "infoInteract": "You can adjust the needle length and line spacing, control the simulation speed, and click anywhere on the canvas to drop a needle at a specific position with a random angle.",
